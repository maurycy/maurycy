Howdy!

I'm **Maurycy Pawłowski-Wieroński**, a software engineer.

- My personal site is [maurycy.com](https://maurycy.com).
- My personal Substack is [maurycy.substack.com](https://maurycy.substack.com).

Writing code for more than two decades. These days I enjoy the extremes: from systems design and figuring out how to use agents in new ways to low-level performance tuning.
