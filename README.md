Howdy!

I'm **Maurycy Pawłowski-Wieroński**, a software engineer.

- My personal site is [maurycy.com](https://maurycy.com).
- My personal Substack is [maurycy.substack.com](https://maurycy.substack.com).

These days I enjoy the extremes: from low-level performance tuning to systems design and figuring out how to use agents in novel ways.
